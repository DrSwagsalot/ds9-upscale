## Upscale Versions

Each time I make a change to the upscale workflow, I'll give it a new version name.
These names will be Dax's hosts in chronological order.

The current version is ***Lela***.

## Media Info

All episodes are released as MKV files, with an H.264 video track, AC3 audio track, SRT subtitle track, and chapter markers.

The audio, subtitles, and chapter markers are unchanged from the DVD rips that are currently on RARBG.

The video resolution is either 1272x960 (Emissary only), 1280x960 (Seasons 1-3), or 1266x960 (Seasons 4-7).
All episodes use the original variable frame timings from the DVD source and have square pixels (converted from the
10:11 or 8:9 anamorphic pixels of the source).

All videos use the H.264 "High" profile and yuv420p chroma-subsampling.

## Where to Find

I won't link to the torrents directly here, to avoid any potential takedown by GitHub.

You can find the magnet link for Season 4 on my Reddit page. I'm **/u/queerspaceworm**.
